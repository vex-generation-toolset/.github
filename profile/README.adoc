The *VEX Tooling Project* is an https://alpha-omega.dev/[Alpha-Omega Fund] initiative providing open-source tooling for analyzing the impact of vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies and generating https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/vex/[VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange)] documents.

These tools support the *entire lifecycle* of VEX document creation, from the disclosure of a vulnerability in a dependency to the automated generation of accurate VEX statements.
The goal is to help organizations determine which vulnerabilities are truly exploitable in their software and communicate that information clearly and efficiently.

== Project Components

https://github.com/vex-generation-toolset/root-cause-service[Root Cause Service]::
Analyzes publicly available data to determine which *method or function* introduces a vulnerability in a third-party dependency.

https://github.com/vex-generation-toolset/java-callgraph[Java CallGraph generator]::
Generates precomputed *call graphs* for Java dependencies to accelerate analysis of which vulnerable methods are *actually invoked* by an application.

https://github.com/vex-generation-toolset/callgraph-metadata[Example call graph database]::
Provides a *sample call graph dataset* containing precomputed call graphs for dependencies used by https://solr.apache.org/[{solr-url}][Apache Solr].

VEX statement generator::
Automatically generates *VEX documents* based on results from the root cause and call graph analyses â€” enabling high-quality, machine-readable vulnerability reports.

GitHub Actions integration::
Provides prebuilt *GitHub Actions* to easily integrate VEX document generation into existing *CI/CD pipelines*, supporting automated vulnerability analysis and reporting.
